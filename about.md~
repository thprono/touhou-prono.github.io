Touhou Prono was founded in 2014 January 26 in the event of blue_bear_94's (`#00000000/IWant2PlayTouhou`) temporary ban from Omnimaga. It strives to be a programming community free from incompetent nineballs who ask stupid questions and say other stupid stuff.

For the first six months of its life, Touhou Prono was a sleeping anarchy, but towards late June, `IWant2PlayTouhou`'s interest in the group rose again and the day before Bastille Day, the Code came into force.

### Okay, but what the fuck does Touhou Prono mean?

Touhou Prono should be regarded as only one word, not two. "Touhou" in that name means fuck all, and so does "Prono" (which was originally going to be "Porno", so I could trick others into thinking that it's NSFW when it's actually not).

### Joining

There are two steps to joining this wonderful group! If you're interested:

1. Click the **Rules** button at the top, download at least the `main.pdf` file, and read it carefully.
2. If you have no problems with the rules, click the **Forum** button to the right of the **Rules** button. It will take you to a Google Groups page, where you can ask to join. Answer the basic questions and `IWant2PlayTouhou` will let you in.

### Members

{% for member in site.data.members %}
  `[#{{ member.id }}] {{ member.user }}` ([github](https://github.com/{{ member.github }})) {% if member.role %}: {{member.role}} {% endif %}
{% endfor %}

**Note**: The number in brackets is a 32-bit identifier assigned to Members. Each Member listed will also have a GitHub link, which is, by the way, required for all of them.
