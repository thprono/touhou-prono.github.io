title: The Mythical Touhou Prono 2.0

Legends speak of a site named Touhou Prono 2.0.

It records all member stats, and has an integrated forum and download section. Most of the code supporting it is written from scratch, and it probably has integration for a dozen other things.

THP 2.0 will probably be programmed either `node.js` or `nope.c`, with a slim chance for Play. If it is written with Django, then I might as well administrate Omnimaga.

Rest assured that this mythical site does not exist ... ***YET***.
